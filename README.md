Word Counter

Description:
Using Ruby this method returns how frequently a word appears in a given string.
User inputs a test word and a phrase of words. The method will output text
with information pertaining to the frequency of the test word in the input phrase.

The method removes any non letters from both strings and makes them lowercase.
Then the method splits the input phrase into an array and compares each word to
the test word. If any of the words in the input phrase are equal to the test
word, the frequency value increases by 1.
